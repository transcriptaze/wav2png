# wav2png

Renders a WAV file as a PNG image, with options to draw a grid, custom colouring and anti-aliasing. 

There are three implementations:

- A command line version (in the _go_ subdirectory), mostly intended for scripting and batch processing
- An online version implemented by compiling this library to WASM, which can be found
  [here](https://transcriptaze.github.io/W2P.html).
- An under development WebGPU implementation (in the _webgpu_ directory) for a faster interactive experience.


## Raison d'Ãªtre

wav2png was initially created as a Go utility library to render an audio file as an anti-aliased waveform for a
WASM project - it just seemed like a good idea to add a standalone command line version.
