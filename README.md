# wav2png

Renders a WAV file as a PNG image, with options to draw a grid, customised colouring and anti-aliasing. Currently only 
supports 16-bit PCM encoded WAV files - support for additional formats is "in the works".

The online version can be found [here](https://transcriptaze.github.io/W2P.html).

## Raison d'Ãªtre

Initially created as a Go utility library to render an audio file as an anti-aliased waveform for a WASM project, 
it is being extended into a standalone command-line utility.
