# wav2png

Renders a WAV file as a PNG image, with options to draw a grid, customised colouring and anti-aliasing. Currently only 
supports 16-bit PCM encoded WAV files - support for additional formats is "in the works".

## Raison d'Ãªtre

it is being extended into a standalone command-line utility.
